# Get Azure DevOps Active Committers

This script will get the active committers from an Azure DevOps organization

## How to run it

The easiest way is to open this repo in GitHub Codespaces:

Or in a dev container in your local machine:

But if you don't want to use a dev container, you can run the script in your local machine:

```bash
./active_commiters.sh
```

> **Note**: This will install gum and jq in your local machine. If you don't want to install them, you can use the dev container or GitHub Codespaces.
